# courseworks
Notebooks from structured assignments and some independent projects.
This repository contains a mix of Jupyter notebooks written during online coursework (mostly Coursera) and independent projects. Some notebooks follow questions from assignments, others explore ideas I built from scratch. All code here was written by me, even if the original assignment context came from external sources.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `coursework/`  
  Notebooks written during structured learning (e.g., Coursera assignments).  
  These follow provided prompts but reflect my own solutions.

- `projects/`  
  Independent explorations, prototypes, and mini builds.  
  Includes tools for genome assembly, clinical workflows, and other experiments.

- `archive/`  
  Older drafts, broken notebooks, or things I might revisit later.

## üìù Notes

- This repo is primarily for safekeeping and sharing‚Äînot everything is polished.
- If you find something useful, feel free to reuse or adapt it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

These notebooks are not intended for clinical use or production environments.  
They reflect personal learning and experimentation.

Some algorithms and concepts in the coursework/ folder are based on materials from the Algorithms for DNA Sequencing course by Ben Langmead. Original teaching resources are available on Langmead Lab‚Äôs GitHub and teaching site. All code here reflects my own implementation and learning.
